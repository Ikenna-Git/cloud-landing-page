# Cloud Landing Page Deployment Project

This project demonstrates how to provision a Linux server, configure a web server, and deploy a simple, responsive landing page using HTML and CSS. It is part of my cloud engineering learning journey focused on understanding real-world deployment and infrastructure management.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The goal was to set up a live, accessible landing page hosted on an EC2 instance using open-source tools and manual configuration steps. It covers basic cloud setup, web server installation, content deployment, and firewall rules configuration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Amazon EC2** ‚Äì Ubuntu 22.04 server instance  
- **Nginx** ‚Äì Web server used for hosting the landing page  
- **HTML/CSS** ‚Äì Static website content  
- **SSH & SCP** ‚Äì Secure access and file transfers  
- **UFW** ‚Äì Firewall management on Ubuntu

---

## üì¶ Steps Taken

### 1. **Provisioning the Server**

- Launched an EC2 instance on AWS using Ubuntu 22.04.
- Added an inbound rule to allow HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22) access.
- Downloaded and configured the `.pem` key for secure SSH access.

### 2. **Connecting to the Server**

```bash
ssh -i my-key.pem ubuntu@<your-ec2-public-ip>
```

### 3. Installing Nginx

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

Verified the installation by visiting http://13.60.63.250 in the browser.

### 4. Enabling Firewall Rules

```bash
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw enable
```

### 5. Deploying the Web Page

- Navigated to the Nginx root directory:

```bash
cd /var/www/html
```

Replaced the default index.html with my custom HTML file.

Transferred the updated index.html, me.jpg, and style.css (if separate) using scp or Termius.

```bash
scp -i my-key.pem index.html ubuntu@<your-ec2-ip>:/var/www/html/
scp -i my-key.pem me.jpg ubuntu@<your-ec2-ip>:/var/www/html/
```

Ensured proper permissions and ownership for all files.

### 6. Viewing the Live Page

Opened a browser and visited http://13.60.63.250 to view the deployed landing page.
